# Reflections

"Reflections" serve as mirrors to your original Cuadds. Cuadds in the form of reflections will be accessible copies of your Cuadd. Any action you perform in your reflections or on your original Cuadd will be reflected across all of them. They are a great way to share information to other collaborators in other cuadds without having to copy
or move information around. 

By clicking on any cuaddÂ´s [**option menu**](./CuaddOptionMenu.md) and pressing on "create reflection in..." you will be able to create a reflection. The navigation menu will apppear and you can move your reflection inside any cuadd on your grid. 

Each reflection will have a blue text, to distinguish them from your original cuadd. Anything you change will
be reflected.

### The difference between ["Reflections"](./Reflections.md) and ["Duplication"](./Duplication.md)

The main difference between these two methods is that when you create a reflection, any changes made inside the reflection or the original Cuadd will be reflected across all of them. For instance, if you change the title of your Cuadd, that change will apply to all its reflections. However, when you duplicate your Cuadd, if you make alterations after copying it, only the copy or the original Cuadd will be affected.
