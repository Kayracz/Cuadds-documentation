# Deleting 

To delete Cuadds, you can individually select the [**option menu**](./CuaddOptionMenu.md) for each Cuadd and delete them one by one.

To delete multiple cuadds we will be able to use multiselection by using **shift** and clicking on the ones we want to delete. After selecting the cuadds, we can click on the option menu and press on "delete cuadd".
