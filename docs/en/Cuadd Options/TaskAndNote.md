# Tasks and Notes

By clicking anywhere on the grid, two elements will appear: a **note** and a **task**.

1. **Task**: By clicking on the "task" icon, you can create Cuadds in list form. This feature allows you to mark tasks as completed and track pending ones.

2. **Note**: In a note Cuadd, you can write text, add links, files, and more, just like a task, but it won't have the ticking feature.

### Create any type of structure

By mixing and matching tasks and notes, you can create various types of lists and organization structures.
