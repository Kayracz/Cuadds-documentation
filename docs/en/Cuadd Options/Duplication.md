# Duplication

To copy or duplicate a Cuadd and create a new one with the same information, you can use the "Duplicate In..." button in your [**cuadds option menu**](./CuaddOptionMenu.md). This will create a copy of the Cuadd you are in.

### The difference between ["Reflections"](./Reflections.md) and ["Duplication"](./Duplication.md)

The main difference between these two methods is that when you create a reflection, any changes made inside the reflection or the original Cuadd will be reflected across all of them. For instance, if you change the title of your Cuadd, that change will apply to all its reflections. However, when you duplicate your Cuadd, if you make alterations after copying it, only the copy or the original Cuadd will be affected.
